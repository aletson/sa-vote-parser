	<h1>Welcome to BigSalesBoard!</h1>

	<div id="body">
		<p>This will be some generic welcome page with calls to action, pricing, and sign up.</p>

		<p>It will be a one page thing where it's all there, similar to any other modern all-in-one techy thing.</p>

		<p>I have a template.</p>
		<?php //InsideSales charges $200 per user per month, but they give you a lot of other crap. We could get away with maybe 30.
